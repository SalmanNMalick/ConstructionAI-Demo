# ConstructionAI-Demo

This repository showcases a suite of Python scripts demonstrating key AI engineering skills for building intelligent platforms in construction technology. It covers AI agent frameworks, data pipelines, multi-agent collaboration, scalable backends, rapid prototyping with reinforcement learning, and workflow integration.

## Features
- **AI Agents**: Automate tasks like knowledge retrieval and data interpretation using LangChain and Hugging Face.
- **Data Pipelines**: Process structured (CSV) and unstructured (text) construction datasets with Pandas and Transformers.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Collaborative planning and reasoning with AutoGen.
- **Backend Services**: RESTful APIs with FastAPI and scalable inference using Ray.
- **Prototyping**: Reinforcement learning for resource optimization in PyTorch.
- **Workflows**: Graph-based modeling of construction processes with NetworkX.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ConstructionAI-Demo.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run individual scripts, e.g., `python agent_framework.py`

## Usage
Each script is standalone but can be integrated. For example:
- Run `data_pipelines.py` with sample data in `examples/`.
- Deploy `backend_services.py` with `uvicorn backend_services:app --reload`.

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` for details. Note: Some scripts require API keys (e.g., Hugging Face, OpenAI for AutoGen).
